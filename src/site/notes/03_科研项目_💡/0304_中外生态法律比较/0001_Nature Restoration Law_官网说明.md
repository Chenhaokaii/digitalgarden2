## EU Nature Restoration Law:

The Regulation on Nature Restoration (Nature Restoration Law) came into effect on Sunday (18 August).The regulation sets binding targets to ***restore degraded ecosystems***, particularly those with the most potential to ***capture and store carbon and to prevent and reduce the impact of natural disasters***.

To align with the 30% protected-area target of the EU Biodiversity Strategy, the law must complement existing directives by fixing deadlines, defining area targets, securing habitat connectivity and allocating ample resources(Hering et al., 2023).

【Specific targets and obligations】

To meet the EU-wide objectives for nature restoration, the Regulation sets ***quantified and time-bound restoration targets for habitats included in Annex I of the Habitats Directive (including forest habitats, peatlands, grasslands, rivers and lakes)*** as well as ***targets for habitats of protected species*** under the Habitats and the Birds Directives, and ***restoration targets for essential marine habitats*** covered by the nature directives and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. 

***Beyond*** the habitats covered by existing legislation, to ensure the continued provisions of ecosystem services to European citizens, the law requires Member States:

- to halt the loss of urban green and increase urban green space and urban tree canopy cover
- to restore the natural connectivity of rivers and the natural functions of related floodplains
- to halt and reverse pollinator decline
- to restore and rewet peatlands under agricultural use
- to put in place measures aiming to increase farmland bird populations and to achieve a positive trend in certain other key biodiversity indicators in agricultural ecosystems
- to achieve a positive trend in a range of biodiversity indicators in forest ecosystems
- to contribute to the EU-level commitment of planting at least three billion additional trees by 2030


- Implications for Practice 
	-  The EU Nature Restoration Law—when finally adopted—***will be the first international*** legally binding, ambitious, holistic, and science-based ***instrument for nature restoration*** and can serve as an example for other jurisdictions. 
	-  A strong EU Nature Restoration Law is essential to streamline restoration efforts by Member States and create a level-playing field, while upscaling the restoration ambition will need strong support from the scientific community. 
	-  Although the amendments of the Proposal *have left its core legal duties largely intact*, the additional loopholes and exemption clauses that have been included in the final version risk limiting its tangible effect on the ground. 
	-  Disinformation by lobby groups risks undermining a science-based legislative proposal on restoration.
